# Performance Modeling SIG

The RISC-V Performance Modelling (and Simulation) SIG drives the strategy and coordinates the development 
of a common performance modelling and cycle-accurate simulation framework for the RISC-V ecosystem--together 
with related topics, such as trace file formats and data-sharing between tools and members.

Performance modelling for RISC-V, as covered by this group, addresses two critical stages of the design lifecycle:

* the prediction of performance for microarchitectural implementation choices, and
* the workload-analysis and evaluation of compilation strategies for specific micro-architectures.

These performance modelling and simulation tools serve as the foundation for predicting the impact of 
workloads, micro-architectural changes, and compiler improvements.  Side-by-side with functional simulation 
(i.e., "fast-model" implemented in QEmu) and the reference model (i.e., SAIL), this covers the entire 
lifecycle of RISC-V development.

The Performance Modelling SIG covers the following activities:

* Provides gap-analysis, strategy-development and outreach for Performance Modelling and Simulation topics f
or the Software HC.
* Coordinates the selection and joint development for the Performance Modelling and Simulation tools 
across the RISC-V membership and ecosystem to reduce duplication of effort and foster the collaboration 
on development activities
* Establishes common interchange formats for trace files and a common repository for trace files of 
representative workloads
* Drives the outreach to external (Open-Source, Academic, and Commercial) projects addressing Performance 
Modelling for RISC-V and actively recruits partners to support RISC-V in their Performance Modelling tools
* Works with membership to establish open-access performance models for low-end (in-order) and
high-end (out-of-order) microarchitectures to foster experimentation with RISC-V in performance modelling
